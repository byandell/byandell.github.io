I retired in 2023 from the University of Wisconsin-Madison after more than 40 years of academic success.
My next direction will be an inspired mix of personal interests and intellectual pursuits.

I am continuing some aspects of my prior research activity,
which fall broadly in the realm of systems thinking.
I collaborate to empower others to develop useful insights from their data.
One way I have done this is to develop software packages,
largely in the [R language](https://www.r-project.org/about.html).
I am moving into a phase of less coding and more guiding of collaborators to leverage existing tools in new ways.

Through a series of `coincidences`, I have become involved in
environmental data science, with particular attention to the needs and creative insights coming out of Indigenous communities about
data science and sovereignty. We all need to work together to
address pressing challenges of climate change, and I am learning
my path in this realm.

Naturally, retirement is a time to reflect on my life and upbringing.
I was inspired by creative parents--my father as a doctor, scientist and humanist, and my mother as a child actress, world traveller and
artist--and see that creative blend in my life and in those of my
siblings.
