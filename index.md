I retired in 2023 from the University of Wisconsin-Madison after more than 40 years of academic success in [stats](https://www.stat.wisc.edu) and [data science](https://datascience.wisc.edu) [^1].
My next direction will be an inspired mix of personal interests and intellectual pursuits.

[^1]: I am [professor emeritus](https://hr.wisc.edu/docs/retirement-emeritus-status.pdf) in [stats](https://www.stat.wisc.edu) and an [affiliate](https://datascience.wisc.edu/institute/dsi-affiliates-list/) of the [DSI](https://datascience.wisc.edu/institute).

I am continuing some aspects of my prior research activity,
which fall broadly in the realm of
[systems thinking](/pages/system/).
I
[collaborate](/pages/collaborate/) to empower others to develop useful
insights from their data.
One way I have done this is to develop
[software projects](/pages/software/),
largely as packages in the
[R language](https://www.r-project.org/about.html).
I am moving into a phase of less coding and more advising of collaborators
to leverage existing tools in new ways.

Through a series of
[coincidences](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/connecting-coincidence/202101/meaningful-coincidences-serendipity-and-synchronicity),
I have become involved in
[environmental data science](/pages/eds/),
with particular attention to the needs and creative insights coming out of
[Indigenous communities about data science and sovereignty](/pages/indigenous).
We all need to work together to
address pressing challenges of climate change, and I am learning
my path in this realm.

Naturally, retirement is a time to
[reflect on my life and upbringing](/pages/reflect/).
I was inspired by creative parents--my father as a doctor, scientist and humanist, and my mother as a child actress, world traveller and
artist--and see that creative blend in my life and in those of my
siblings.
