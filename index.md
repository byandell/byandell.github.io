I retired in 2023 from the University of Wisconsin-Madison as
[professor emeritus](https://hr.wisc.edu/docs/retirement-emeritus-status.pdf)
after more than 40 years of academic success in
[stats](https://www.stat.wisc.edu),
including founding the [data science institute](https://dsi.wisc.edu).
My new directions mix personal interests and intellectual pursuits.

I continue to explore
[systems thinking](/pages/system/)
through
[collaborative](/pages/collaborate/)
teams developing useful insights from data.
I have led
[software projects](/pages/software/),
largely as packages and shiny web apps using the
[R language](https://www.r-project.org/about.html).
I am curious to learn how ongoing partnerships will evolve new, and hopefully widely accessible and relevant, data-rich tools.

I have worked for decades with a biochemistry-based team on
[system genetics](/pages/sysgen/)
of diabetes, obesity and diet.
Through a series of recent
[coincidences](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/connecting-coincidence/202101/meaningful-coincidences-serendipity-and-synchronicity),
I have become involved in
[environmental data science](/pages/eds/),
with particular attention to the needs and creative insights coming out of
[Indigenous communities about data science and sovereignty](/pages/indigenous).
We all need to work together to
address pressing challenges of climate change, and I am learning
my path in this realm.

Naturally, retirement is a time to
[reflect on my life and upbringing](/pages/reflect/).
I was inspired by creative parents--my father as a doctor, scientist and humanist, and my mother as a child actress, world traveller and
artist--and see that creative blend in my life and in those of my
siblings.
