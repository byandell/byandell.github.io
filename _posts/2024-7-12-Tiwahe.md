We travelled on Wednesday way up Boulder Canyon Drive to join others for a walk in the woods behind
[Jim Sanovia](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sanovia/)'s
home, located at 9500 feet.
[Phil Two Eagle](https://www.linkedin.com/in/philimon-d-two-eagle-32805710/),
leader of our
[Maka Sitomniya Working Group](https://cu-esiil.github.io/Maka-Sitomniya/),
drove me and two other senior western researchers,
[Bob Newman](https://campus.und.edu/directory/robert.newman)
and
[Rob Rabin](https://www.cira.colostate.edu/staff/rabin-robert-m/).
We marvelled at the beautiful creek and debated about how to work together with data tools to study the changing climate and land of
[Oceti Sakawin](https://americanindian.si.edu/nk360/plains-belonging-nation/oceti-sakowin)
in a manner that respects
[inherent sovereignty](https://www.ienearth.org/what-is-indigenous-sovereignty-and-tribal-sovereignty/)
of the Lakota.

This walk, and lovely meal prepared by Jim and Lilly Jones-Sanovia,
offered a welcome respite from our days-long meetings at
[ESIIL](https://esiil.org).
Our goal, I thought, was to get to work on creating the tools that would bring together data from multiple sources so that Lakota researchers could study aspects of the land, water, air, and environmental challenges including mining, pollution, and public health.
These were paramount, but first we needed to come together, and not just in person, physically.

We began on Monday finding a tree outside in a grassy area and arranging ourselves in a circle.
Phil offered a prayer for the work ahead.
[James Rattling Leaf](https://nccasc.colorado.edu/partners/who-we-are/james-rattling-leaf-sr)
opened a Cuban cigar box containing an abalone shell and sage,
and lit the sage for Phil.
Phil came to each of us in the circle to enable us to cleanse our spirit with the sage.
After, we each introduced ourselves and acknowledged what we bring to this meeting.
We were now ready to begin.
Rather, this was our beginning, our meeting each other and connecting with a higher spiritual guidance.

We went upstairs to begin the work in earnest, or so I thought.
Naturally, we started with arranging chairs and tables in a circle and addressing community care for our meeting, led by
[Susan Sullivan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/susan-sullivan-6247bb16/).
Phil laid out a vision of building a "data cube" that would initially include tools to articulate and study treaty boundaries, mining resources, and water.
I thought we would dive into the technical aspects of these three components.
Yet, we still needed to get to know one another.
That is, we needed to become a family and establish trust.

And we had much to learn from each other about what a "data cube" might be.
Is it one thing, with multiple layers (think map apps on your phone that overlay landscape, streets, traffic, and alerts)?
Is it a collection of tools? one portal or multiple?
Who will have access? Where will it reside?

As discussion weaved around the circle, it became clear that we had many different ideas, and these were not always compatible.
Frustration seemed to slow us down, but we kept finding ways to listen to each other.
We all valued the opportunity to hear every voice.
So, on one level I felt we were not making much progress--where was this mysterious data cube?--but on another level I noticed that we were beginning to find common threads, and to see each other more clearly.

I could continue to describe the meeting, but I don't have the right to share those details here.
Rather, I will focus on my journey.
I came to the meeting thinking that I have a lot to share,
as a retired, senior faculty, with title Professor Emeritus, and decades of
experience in collaboration, working with data, and coding in
[R](https://cran.r-project.org/),
[Rstudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)
and
[Shiny](https://mastering-shiny.org/).
I would be a resource, sharing my wisdom and offering advice.
Yes, there is that, but ...

I came to realize late in the week that I still have much to learn,
and that the more I focussed on listening the better.
Yes, I sort of knew this intellectually, but it is hard to let go of
the ego trip of being an expert, knowing things worth imparting.

I learned from members of our working group family
that I was a beginner, an innocent in so many ways.
Part of that involves collaborating with individuals from other cultures,
in this case both the broad field of environmental sciences and people
of the Lakota Nation.

Phil articulated the four levels of traditional government, which are intimately woven with the four levels of kinship and relationship:

- _Tiwahe_: innocent
- _Tiospaye_: youth
- _Ospaye_: adult
- _Oyate_: elder

I found some exposition of this in Oseu 4 of
[Oceti Sakowin: Essential Understandings & Standards](https://sdtribalrelations.sd.gov/docs/OSEUs-18.pdf).
Here I thought of myself as some sort of "elder",
when in fact I am an inocent, at the level of _tiwahe_.
I found this initially embarrassing (for my presumption of senior leadership) and later humbling.
Finally, I found it exciting and envigorating,
as it means I am starting a new journey.
I still have my templates and biases to strip away,
but I felt an opening to connect more with members of this family.
On the closing session, when we were each asked to say a word or
phrase that encapsulated the week, I chose _tiwahe_ and remarked
on how I felt to be innocent and a beginner.

Now, I am preparing for another journey, to the
[Wild12](https://wild.org/wild12/) 
World Wilderness Conference being held in Rapid City, ND,
hosted by the
[Sicangu Lakota Treaty Council](https://www.facebook.com/groups/976476869099234/) ,
which is led by Phil Two Eagle.
I will see Phil and James, along with other Lakota friends,
at this meeting.
And I will meet others from around the world who are gathering
to reinterpret "wilderness ... through the lens of traditional cultures, rooting Indigenous principles and lifeways at the center of the movement to keep Earth wild."
