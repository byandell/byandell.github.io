## Assignment

I spent a week (24-26 May 2023) in Stat 678, Introduction to Statistical Consulting, having students think and write about data sovereignty as it relates to their Statistics masters option degree programs in[ Statistics and Data Science](https://stat.wisc.edu/graduate-admissions/data-science-option/) or[ Applied Statistics](https://stat.wisc.edu/graduate-admissions/applied-statistics-option/). Below is the assignment. Reports are in this folder:

* [Data Sovereignty #1](/pages/Data_Sovereignty_2023_1/)
* [Data Sovereignty #2](/pages/Data_Sovereignty_2023_1/) 

This unit concerns Indigenous data sovereignty as it relates to statistics and data science collaboration. The goal is for you to be able to explain what Indigenous data sovereignty is, and to articulate (in a 1-2 page report) how data sovereignty may affect how you approach statistics consulting and collaboration. Consider the discussion and questions below, and examine the references, resources and videos found at the bottom to inform your report.

## Data Sovereignty

An important broad concept is "open data", which might seem to capture data sovereignty but actually falls far short. Open data is codified in the FAIR principles--data should be Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable. However this ignores important principles that affect marginalized groups, including Indigenous peoples. Recently GIDA developed the CARE principles--Collective benefit, Authority to control, Responsibility and Ethics. How do these enrich our thinking of ethical statistics collaboration?

Below are quotes from three of the references, which capture some flavor of the challenges of open data and data sovereignty. What are the key issues that you might encounter during your career in this regard?

"Open data is a site of tension for Indigenous peoples. Open data provides opportunities for sustainable development according to Indigenous aspirations, yet also sits at the nexus of current and historic data challenges as a result of colonisation, bias, and a lack of knowledge of Indigenous rights. Indigenous data sovereignty (IDS) provides a framework for maximising the benefit of open data for Indigenous peoples and other users of Indigenous data and for affecting the stewardship of all data. Open data communities often assume many binaries, including a single government actor (nation-states), that data is open or not, and that open data is useful data (devoid of biases and relevance issues). In the context of Indigenous peoples, there are clear challenges for the mainstream open data movement around these binaries, as well as paths forward to assure the protection of Indigenous rights and data for development." [Raine et al. 2019: Indigenous Data Sovereignty]

"Indigenous sciences are foundationally based in relationships, reciprocity, and responsibilities. These sciences constitute systems of knowledge developed through distinct perspectives on and practices of knowledge creation and decision-making that not only have the right to be pursued on their own terms but may also be vital in solving critical twenty-first-century challenges. “Science” is often treated as if it were a single entity, free of cultural influences and value-neutral in principle. Western science is often seen as instantiating and equivalent to this idealized, yet problematic, view of science. We argue for engagement with multiple perspectives on science in general, and increased engagement with Indigenous sciences in particular. As scholars focused on human learning and development, we share empirical examples of how Indigenous sciences, sometimes in partnership with Western science, have led to new discoveries and insights into human learning and development.... Native stem students ... [pursue] themes of giving back to the community and of education as a process of transformation.... They strive to acquire knowledge and tools generated from the sciences as a way to contribute to community needs and goals, based on principles of relationality, reciprocity, and responsibility commonly found in Indigenous knowledge systems." [Bang et al. 2018: Daedelus]

"Research computing infrastructure—one component of what the National Science Foundation (NSF) terms cyberinfrastructure (CI)—has led the world in transformational ways, but with considerable gaps in services for software and data capabilities. Moreover, the composition of the people supporting and utilizing the cyberinfrastructure does not sufficiently represent the diversity of society. The scale of the challenge is reflected in what the NSF leadership and National Science Board (NSB) terms the “missing millions”—those who are yet to be engaged for the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce so that it reflects the racial, ethic, and gender representation in the general population. Broadening the accessibility of CI investments to reach the missing millions promises tremendous gains for the national research enterprise and its impacts on society." [Blatecky et al. 2021: The Missing Millions]
