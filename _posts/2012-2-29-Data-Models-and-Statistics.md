title: Strategic Planning--Data, Models and Statistics
---

We now live in an information age with access to huge amounts of data in our daily lives
through IT advances, but with great uncertainty about what these data actually mean. These
data arise from business, manufacturing, finance, science, medicine, engineering, political
science and a great many other fields. Every UW student must be quantitatively literate to
survive and thrive in their future careers, regardless of area. With few exceptions, to advance
and remain competitive campus researchers must have the skills and tools to analyze and
interpret the massive data streams that permeate the contemporary research world. Training
in statistical methods, and collaboration with statisticians, is central to this vital part of the
University of Wisconsin-Madison mission.

Professor Paul Ahlquist, director of the virology group of MIR and working with the Statistics
Department on the first joint UW-MIR faculty hire, recently stated that new advances in cancer
biology are “increasingly linked with the creative application of computational and statistical
methods”. Many other prominent faculty at UW-Madison, including Jamie Thomson, David
Schwartz and Alan Attie, highly value their collaborations with statistics colleagues on
forefront research. The rise of statistics as an essential tool in society has been widely noticed
in the New York Times and other media (see www.stat.wisc.edu/dept-history [1]): “Arcane
statistical analysis, the business of making sense of our growing data mountains, has become
high tech’s hottest calling.” “In field after field, … the digital data surge only promises to
accelerate.” “The big problem is going to be the ability of humans to use, analyze and make
sense of the data.” “Companies from all sectors look for statistics experts, including
pharmaceutical and insurance companies and Wall Street firms.... 'You need statistical
analysis to do anything regarding research and to assess various alternatives, whether it’s in
alternative energy or health care'.”

Among quantitative sciences, statistics is at the center of data analysis and interpretation. The
Department of Statistics, and the affiliated Biometry Program and Department of Biostatistics
& Medical Informatics, have been extremely active and successful leaders in teaching and
research of quantitative methods over the past 50 years. However, the information age is
changing rapidly, expanding into more and more fields, and the size of the data acquisition is
orders of magnitude larger than ever existed or imagined before. The statistical methods to
analyze these mega data sets have to a large extent not yet been developed. For now, we
must rely on inadequate, legacy methods designed for simpler problems. To keep pace, the
Department of Statistics has reviewed its current teaching and training programs, examined
its faculty research portfolio, and reflected on campus and society needs to develop this
strategic plan for the next decade.

We propose a revival and strengthening of George Box's 1960 vision wherein the department
of statistics has a strong central core of faculty appointed at 100% in the department,
combined with specialists with joint appointments who collaborate with researchers across the
campus. Today, however, we need new resources coupled with a renewed vision to excel.
Other top statistics programs across the country are moving in this direction (e.g. University of
California-Berkeley, Stanford University, and University of Chicago). More broadly, many
universities are increasingly recognizing the need to examine data in context of its source
—precisely the domain of statistics—as a central component of training for all students.

To achieve a renewed vision, the Department will continue to transform its training program,
including its curriculum. Implementing this strategic plan will require an increase in personnel,
both 100% and joint appointments. Over the next 5-10 years, we propose hiring 3 new staff
FTE and 5 new tenure-track faculty FTE, two or three to be at a more senior level, to address
these mushrooming needs. Staff FTE will cover undergraduate advising and oversight of
undergraduate instruction, instructional computing and tools for data analysis, and research
computing and big data analytics infrastructure. New statistics faculty will focus on tomorrow’s
big data problems, with emphasis on joint appointments in research disciplines and in other
campus data sciences programs.

## Strategic Design Themes

This strategic plan embodies three broad themes essential for teaching, training, methodology
development, and research collaboration focused on modern statistical analysis and
inference.
* Students learn statistical concepts best through experience with data. To illustrate how the
theoretical results work, instructors need to teach students basic skills of data management
and analysis in settings similar to science laboratories. Having centralized staff and teaching
resources will eliminate duplication, reduce confusion, and improve educational outcomes.
* Today’s problems require strong data modeling skills to derive methods to analyze big data
sets with complicated structures. These pervade collaborative research and are
increasingly involved in instruction in many degree programs. Having staff knowledgeable in
best practices, and new faculty conversant in big data methods for statistical models, will
deepen and enhance the quality of scholarly activity.
* Modern statistical inference demands that students develop skills to efficiently implement
data analysis methods. These include numerical methods, symbol manipulation, and
methods for complicated data objects. Students in intermediate and advanced statistics
courses need to learn best practices for building, maintaining and evolving algorithms. This is
essential for big data research, where the volume of data requires development of high
throughput or high performance tools.

There is currently a disconnect between the forefront “big data” problems that drive research
across campus and the small data problems taught in the classroom. We propose to fill this
gap with major educational innovations, including flexible modularity in course design, to
import modern research methods into the classroom, and to provide opportunities for young
researchers to become involved in quantitative research teams early in their academic
experience.

## Transforming UW-Madison

The Statistics Department is being asked to provide leadership on many fronts to transform
the campus landscape, through increased demand for introductory and intermediate courses,
requests for collaborations, and guidance on research data policy at all levels. We can only
meet these external demands with increased resources, notably in faculty and staff lines, as
recommended during the 2010 department review. This is in the broad interest of L&S and of
UW-Madison as a whole.

The Biometry Program Consulting Facility and the BMI Comprehensive Cancer Shared
Resource are two examples of George Box’s 1960 vision, demonstrating top quality
communication of technical tasks across multiple biological disciplines, and resulting in highly
productive research collaborations. Most statistics faculty and students are involved in
interdisciplinary research across campus—with Jamie Thomson, David Schwarz, Paul
Ahlquist, Richard Davidson, Miron Livny, Michael Ferris, and many others. Many more
researchers across campus need our expertise in design and analysis; their demands already
exceed available resources. Our Statistics Department is one of the very few places on
campus (and the nation) where graduate students receive formal instruction and credentials
in the art and science of collaboration with researchers from other disciplines. We want to
extend Box vision in today’s information tsunami, and we welcome new opportunities, backed
by resources, to revolutionize how big data scholarship evolves at UW-Madison.

As an example of the scope of the problem, consider the explosion of genomic data, with
expectations of petabytes and exabytes in the near future (Schadt et al. 2010, Trelles et al.
2011). Unfortunately, methods to interpret these data are at a very early stage. Tragically,
poorly designed studies yield vast but useless data, resulting in much lost time and scarce
research funds. The Economist, New York Times, Science and Nature Medicine, as well as
CBS 60 Minutes, covered the unraveling of a widely heralded genomics-based cancer
therapy in 2011-12: “Medical researchers see the story as a call to action. With such huge
data sets and complicated analyses, researchers can no longer trust their hunches that a
result does–or does not–make sense”. The data problems were detected and published two
years earlier by statisticians Baggerly and Coombes at MD Anderson Cancer Center, but it
took evidence of fraud to bring the case to public attention.

## Statistics Department Mission

The ongoing mission of the Department of Statistics has four objectives:
<br>
**Research:**To meet continuing advances in science and technology, (including evolving
challenges of big data), develop new statistical theory, concepts, experimental designs,
methodology, and computational tools to improve understanding of complex processes
through data reduction, analysis, interpretation, and inference.
<br>
**Instruction:** To train BS, MS, and PhD statistics students for careers in academia, industry
and government; to teach students in other degree programs the essential statistical concepts
and tools for their research; to train non-traditional students in data analytic concepts and
methods.
<br>
**Quantitative Reasoning:** To educate all students on campus about quantitative reasoning
with data; to address fears of statistics by building the confidence to tackle data-rich problems
with minimal theory.
<br>
**Collaboration:** To provide and promote statistical collaboration in a multitude of disciplines,
within as well as outside the university, through collaborative research, consulting, and
training; to foster a climate of mutual respect among quantitative and discipline-focused
researchers.

## Data Sciences at UW-Madison

“Computer Science has historically been strong on data structures…. Statistics has
historically been … strong on inference from data. [We must] draw on the strengths of both
disciplines.” Michael Jordan, Professor at UC-Berkeley Statistics & EECS, in 2010 UW
lecture).

Statistics is one of the data sciences, with the unique role of studying how to infer from
specific data to a more general setting, taking into account the randomness and uncertainty
inherent in data. UW-Madison has six other data science programs, all building on the
foundations of Mathematics: Computer Science (L&S), Biostatistics & Medical Informatics
(SMPH), Electrical & Computer Engineering (CoE), Industrial & Systems Engineering (CoE),
Operations and Information Management (Business School) and Library and Information
Studies (SLIS). In particular, Statistics and Computer Science have had a long history of
collaboration and mutual respect at UW-Madison, with both having joint faculty in BMI.

## Statistics and Big Data

Historically, almost all statisticians have shared a similar core education. Unlike fields such as
history, where a specialist in Russian history might not fill a need in colonial Latin American
history, statistics enables broadly trained individuals to move easily into a number of areas.
Our department has had the tradition of hiring the best individual within broad boundaries,
and this has been largely successful. Overall, the Statistics Department has provided
internationally regarded excellence that balances theory and applications. However, this
approach needs to be modified.

Specialization in training of new PhD graduates has increased as the discipline has grown.
While we will always emphasize the need to hire from the pool of strongest candidates,
changes in the discipline encourage addressing particular needs, notably in the area of big
data. As noted in our 2002 vision statement, we expect a majority of future hires to involve
heavy computation and attention to large data problems. Recent hires reflect this trend. Thus,
a revised hiring paradigm is to hire the individual who can make the most impact in modern
statistics, and who can do that in ways that strengthen education and collaboration on
campus and globally. A 2008 conference on teaching statistics emphasized important shifts in
the field of statistics in terms of training:

[Nolan and Temple Lange (2010)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/20799880) argued, “The nature of statistics is changing significantly with
many opportunities to…impact…science and policy…. Computational literacy and
programming are as fundamental to statistical practice and research as mathematics.”
Students should gain “the ability to reason about computational resources, work with large
datasets, and perform computationally intensive tasks” of “statistical inquiry…working with
data.” “Students need to gain explicit experience with…programming language concepts ....”

Data skills are critical for modern statisticians, and central to our instructional and research
programs. Statisticians do not simply use computers as tools; rather, we derive and
implement new data science methods. This requires programming skills. Indeed, the
statistical methods and computational tools needed for tomorrow’s data do not exist today;
they barely exist for today’s data. Thus, students need deeper skills valuable to conducting
research and developing new data reduction and analysis methods.

## Consequences of Not Hiring in Statistics

The consequences of not hiring new staff and faculty in statistics are extensive. The campus
cannot maintain the quality of instruction for undergraduates in the design of experiments and
the analysis of data using appropriate data models and analytic methods—the core subjects
of statistics—without having more long-term staff who are engaged in state-of-the-art
statistics research. On a broader scale, many universities are increasingly recognizing the
need to examine data in context of its source—precisely the domain of statistics—as a central
component of training for all students.

Statistics faculty and graduate students engage in collaborative research across campus
involving undergraduates, graduates, post-docs, staff and faculty. How many hundreds of
millions of dollars in grants have come to UW-Madison through the involvement of statistics
faculty? Currently $1.5M per year are processed directly through the Statistics Department.
External funding of biostatistics and medical informatics faculty in BMI related to Institute for
Clinical and Translational Research (ICTR) and other collaborations across campus brings in
$1.2M per year. Statistics faculty in the Biometry Program are PIs or co-PIs on roughly $1.7M
of extramural annual federal funding. Many other researchers on campus owe their grant
success to collaborations with statisticians.

The statistics faculty are stretched to the limit, and have been for many years. The demand
for statistics collaboration is growing at a tremendous pace, and is leading to a new
splintering of statistics leadership on campus, which is oddly similar to the situation
encountered by Box upon his arrival in 1960. In short, the health of the Statistics Department
is a campus-level concern. While directly administered by L&S, Statistics has involvement
and needs critical thinking and leadership from schools and colleges across the campus. For
example. the Department of Biostatistics and Medical Informatics depends on a strong
Statistics Department for training programs and instruction as well as fostering a synergy
between faculty for methodology research. How will UW-Madison respond to this challenge?
How will it meet this need? We offer this strategic plan as a roadmap for meeting these
exciting new challenges. Details are in separate appendices concerning instruction, research
and a hiring plan.
