## What is Indigenous Data Sovereignty?

Indigenous Data Sovereignty (IDS) has emerged as a critical concept that advocates for the
rights of Indigenous peoples to control their data. This includes not only data about
individuals but also data about their communities, lands, and resources. IDS acknowledges
the importance of respecting Indigenous cultures, traditions, and ways of knowing, and
recognizes that Indigenous peoples have a unique relationship with their data that is rooted
in their history, language, and worldview.

## Indigenous and Western Sciences

The main point of this paper [1] is to explore the relationship between Indigenous sciences
and Western sciences, and whether there is potential for mutual understanding and
collaboration between the two. The authors argue for engagement with multiple perspectives
on science and the value of Indigenous sciences in particular. They provide empirical
examples of how Indigenous sciences, sometimes in partnership with Western science, have
led to new discoveries and insights into human learning and development, as well as
environmental sustainability. Additionally, the paper highlights the importance of recognizing
and valuing different cultural orientations and knowledge systems, and the need to move
away from the myth of a value-neutral, cultureless Western science. Thus, the paper
advocates for a heterogeneity of sciences that values multiple systems of knowing and
engages with methodologies developed within different cultural communities.

### What's special about indigenous science?

Indigenous science is significant because it builds knowledge about the world
through a unique set of orienting values, concepts, and questions, anchored in
relational epistemologies. The principles of Indigenous sciences, such as the notion
that everything is related and mutually interconnected, influence how humans live
and the responsibilities they have to nature, including plants, animals, and the land.
An ecological premise grounds the questions and methods of most Indigenous
sciences, fulfilling ethical responsibilities that contribute to the larger collective good.
As we face the challenges of climate change, we need to reimagine interdependent
relationships with and responsibilities to nature, and Indigenous sciences can expand
our collective knowledge and help us meet these challenges. Furthermore, the
engagement with Indigenous sciences requires recognizing, cultivating, and
supporting Indigenous peoples and their efforts To create thriving communities, and
transforming the institutional structures that have consistently undermined
Indigenous ways of life. Therefore, it is critical to form new ethical partnerships with
Indigenous peoples, prioritizing Indigenous self-determination and leadership.

### What's the major difference between Western and Indigenous sciences?

There are fundamental cultural differences between Indigenous and Western
sciences. Indigenous sciences prioritize relational epistemologies, which value the
interconnectedness and interdependence of all living beings and ecosystems. In
contrast, Western science historically emphasizes objectivity and detachment,
seeking to explain the universe through the lens of empirical evidence and logic.
While some of the dimensions of Indigenous sciences may overlap with those in
Western sciences, such as observation and explanation, there are significant
differences in the guiding principles, questions, and methods of knowledge building.
Indigenous sciences are also often driven by a set of values, including reciprocity,
responsibility, and sustainability, which are different from those typically foregrounded
in Western science.

However, open data communities present challenges for Indigenous peoples. For example,
there may be biases and inaccuracies in data collection, which can further marginalised
Indigenous communities. The CARE and FAIR principles developed by GIDA provide a
framework for ensuring that open data benefits Indigenous peoples and respects their rights.

## FAIR and CARE Principles

Open data is data that anyone can freely use, share, and build on. The FAIR principles are
guidelines to make data more Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable for
humans and computers. They emphasize that data should be machine-actionable, meaning
that computers should be able to find, access, interoperate, and reuse data with little or no
human intervention.

However, the FAIR principles do not fully engage with Indigenous Peoples rights and
interests in data. They do not address issues such as collective benefit, authority to control,
responsibility, and ethics that affect marginalized groups. The CARE principles, developed
by the Global Indigenous Data Alliance (GIDA), are designed to guide the inclusion of
Indigenous Peoples in data governance across contemporary data ecosystems. They bring
a people-and-purpose orientation to data governance, which complements the data-centric
nature of the FAIR principles.

The CARE principles enrich our thinking of ethical statistics collaboration by highlighting the
importance of respecting and protecting Indigenous Peoples’ sovereignty, agency, and
dignity in data. They also encourage us to consider how data can be used for collective
benefit and social justice, rather than just for scientific or commercial purposes. They
challenge us to think beyond technical aspects of data quality and interoperability, and to
engage with ethical and relational aspects of data governance. They invite us to collaborate
with Indigenous Peoples as equal partners in data initiatives that affect them. Indigenous
people want to have greater control over their data and knowledge being spread. Through
the CARE principles, Indigenous peoples have the right to self-determination, possess, use,
consent, refuse, and reclaim their data for governance. As well as, they have the right to
govern, define, privacy, know, associate, and benefit from their data. The CARE principles reflect an important change in hopes of advancing Indigenous people’s information and
promoting ethical data sharing practices.

The CARE principles stand for collective benefit, authority to control, responsibility, and
ethics. They focus mostly on Indigenous peoples’ data governance and emphasise the
importance of respecting their rights to control their data. To elaborate more on the CARE
principles, here are some examples of how they can be applied in practice:

- Collective benefit: Data collectors and users should ensure that Indigenous Peoples
have access to their own data and can use it for their own purposes, such as
improving health outcomes, preserving cultural heritage, or advancing
self-determination. Data collectors and users should also seek consent from
Indigenous Peoples before sharing or reusing their data for other purposes, and
ensure that they share the benefits of such activities with them.
- Authority to control: Data collectors and users should recognize and respect the
rights of Indigenous Peoples to govern their own data according to their own laws,
values, and protocols. Data collectors and users should also consult with Indigenous
Peoples on how their data should be stored, managed, accessed, and disposed of.
- Responsibility: Data collectors and users should adhere to ethical standards and best
practices when working with Indigenous data, such as ensuring data quality, security,
privacy, and confidentiality. Data collectors and users should also monitor and
evaluate the impacts of their data activities on Indigenous Peoples and their
environments, and report any harms or risks to them.
- Ethics: Data collectors and users should respect the cultural diversity and integrity of
Indigenous Peoples and their knowledge systems when working with their data. Data
collectors and users should also acknowledge the sources and origins of Indigenous
data and knowledge, and give proper attribution and recognition to them.

The FAIR and CARE Principles enrich our thinking of ethical statistics collaboration by
ensuring that people are working in an ethical and respectful manner while sharing data. The
CARE principles can guide researchers to work with Indigenous people and collaborate to
provide the public with correct information. This will ensure respecting the Indigenous
peoples’ culture in an ethical and responsible way that protects the Indigenous communities.
By following these principles, data collectors and users can foster more ethical statistics
collaboration with Indigenous Peoples that is based on mutual trust, respect, reciprocity, and
benefit. This can also lead to more accurate, relevant, and useful data that can support both
scientific advancement and Indigenous wellbeing.

By respecting the rights of Indigenous peoples, statisticians can work collaboratively with
these communities to ensure that their data is used in a way that benefits them and does not
perpetuate existing power imbalances.

## Summary

The key issues that we might encounter during our career with regard to open data and data
sovereignty are:

- A careful balance between the advantages of open data and the protection of
indigenous rights is necessary. When accessing the data,We should protect the
rights and sentiments of other individuals.
- Recognizing the complexity of data is essential, and making binary assumptions
should be avoided. It is our duty and responsibility to promote IDS(Indigenous Data
Sovereignty) to ensure open data benefits and respect their community.
- Having a variety of people involved in research computing infrastructure is important.
However, if the people building and using it don't come from different backgrounds
and communities, it won't reflect the real world.We need to promote diversity in the
community and encourage greater variety of people in STEM development.
- Acknowledging and collaborating with Indigenous sciences alongside western
science is crucial for promoting mutual learning and development.We can create a
fairer and more robust system for data that benefits everyone involved by embracing
Indigenous data sovereignty principles, considering various viewpoints on science,
and encouraging inclusivity and accessibility in research computing infrastructure.
