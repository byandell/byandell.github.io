title: Indigenous Data Science

My efforts to network around
[environmental data science (EDS)](/pages/eds/)
during the 2020s have put me in touch with several talented Indigenous data scientists who are teaching me much about
[Data Sovereignty](/Data-Sovereignty/),
[Traditional Knowledge](https://www.wipo.int/tk),
and how we might better collaborate in the future to heal the planet. I am curious about how these new conversations and collaborations will evolve my thinking and contributions.

## Organizations and Communities

This list is primarily about Indigenous data science, but includes other links
pertinent to EDS and climate change. For instance,
[Digital Mappa](https://www.digitalmappa.org/)
is a system to network maps and ancient scrolls/texts, which could be quite useful for organizing sovereign documents.
[350](https://350.org/)
and
[Project DrawDown](https://drawdown.org/)
are global efforts to address climate change, growing connections with Indigenous communities.
