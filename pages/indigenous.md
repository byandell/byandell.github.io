My efforts to network around [environmental data science (EDS)](/pages/eds/) during the 2020s have put me in touch with several talented Indians who are teaching me much about [Data Sovereignty](/Data-Sovereignty/), Traditional Knowledge,
and how we might better collaborate in the future to heal the planet. I am curious about how these new conversations and collaborations will evolve my thinking and contributions.
