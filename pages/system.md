title: Systems Thinking
---

Much of my "work/career" has involved thinking about complicated systems,
which do not readily lend themselves to easy (mathematical or statistical)
resolution.
I give [Bland Ewing](/pages/ewing/#my-involvement-with-bland-ewing), and my parents, major credit to my embrace of projects
and perspectives that defy simple models and approaches. Interestingly,
this has led to a broad-based journey on multiple levels, with me sometimes
doubting the coherence of my approach.

I am now embracing this "systems thinking" approach as I explore connections
among projects that have intrigued me for decades.
