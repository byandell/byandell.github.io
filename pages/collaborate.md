My career has been a series of collaborations,
some brief, but others lasting for decades.
Examples of these can be found in my academic [CV](https://pages.stat.wisc.edu/~yandell/vita.pdf),
while others are in my book, 
[Practical Data Analysis for Designed Experiments](http://www.stat.wisc.edu/~yandell/pda).

Beyond my direct collaborations, I have strived
to foster collaboration in multiple ways.
For most of my faculty life, I was a member of the Biometry Program, a collaboration between the Statistics Department and the College of Agricultural & Life Sciences (CALS),
directing that program for my last six years.
This involved coordinating a team of academic staff and graduate students who met periodically
with CALS and other researchers to review and
improve experimental design and data analysis.
Many of these collaborations led to research
publications or federal grant support.

I continued this spirit of collaboration into
the creation of the [Data Science Hub](https://datascience.wisc.edu/hub) (co-creator) and the [Data Science Institute](https://datascience.wisc.edu/institution) (founding director).
