Some think coaching is for weak people who need a crutch.
In fact, coaching is for everyone.
It has helped me become a better leader, advisor, and partner,
in my professional life, and is transforming my personal life.

For me, coaching is a partnership (with a coach) to chart my path forward.
I employed an executive coach while I was founding director of the
[Data Science Institute](https://datascience.wisc.edu/institute).
That helped me improve my leadership and build multiple partnerships to launch
a new type of campus entity. DSI is now thriving under its director,
and will be an integral part of the new
[School of Computer, Data & Information Sciences building](https://cdis.wisc.edu/building/).

Recently, I have been working with a retirement coach to chart a different
type of path forward.
This web site is only part of that path.
