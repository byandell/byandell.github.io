Some think coaching is for weak people who need a crutch.
In fact, coaching is for everyone, particularly for leaders who are already successful and are looking for further improvement.
It has helped me become a better [team leader](/pages/team/), advisor, and partner,
in my professional life, and is transforming my personal life.

For me, coaching is a partnership (with a coach) to chart my path forward.
I employed an executive coach while I was founding director of the
[Data Science Institute](https://datascience.wisc.edu/institute).
That helped me improve my leadership and build multiple partnerships to launch
a new type of campus entity. DSI is now thriving under its director,
and will be an integral part of the new
[School of Computer, Data & Information Sciences building](https://cdis.wisc.edu/building/).

Recently, I have been working with a retirement coach to chart a different
type of path forward.
This web site is only part of that path.

### 13 Unity

waves on ocean

* We surf on the ocean
* Ocean is separate from our wave-ness
* we experience the ups and downs of wave life
    * We love the ups and strive for them
    * We fear the downs and work to avoid them
* Ultimate fulfillment: awake from the dream of our separate wave-ness
* we were always one with the Ocean, never separate, all waves are one
* we are eternal ocean itself, and there is no death, only a change of form
* there is only abiding love, bliss, joy, and freedom

no self, all god

development turned upside down

* movement into Unity is different
* ego is not matured into Unity—it is surrendered
* you must forget yourself

**2 arguments for development**

* if you want to develop mastery in the art of leadership, a mature Structure of Mind is required.
* development into mature Structures of Mind and Identity is preliminary to breakthrough to Unity, the arduous work of surrendering identity altogether

not me, not me

* Adolescence to Reactive Mind: not independent capability to meet egocentric needs
* Reactive to Creative Mind: not external identity needing outside validation for worth and security
* Creative to Integral Mind: not hard-earned, self-authoring, authentic version of ourselves 
* we are many selves, perhaps even all selves

unity leadership

* we need mature leadership to emerge to make critical difference in planet outcome
* requires Integral Mind leading from presumption of our inherent Unity
* find global systemic solutions that usher in a thriving future for all planet inhabitants 
* Leadership Imperative

### From LinkedIn

After 4 decades, … I now focus on writing about my discoveries and concerns…. I shifted my attention from adult development theories to re-exploring values and character development…. I [am] writing the book on ego development theory from a perspective that includes an appreciation of [non-WEIRD definitions](https://wiki.p2pfoundation.net/WEIRD_vs_Non-WEIRD_Psychology_and_Culture) of what it means to be a person in Indigenous cultures…. Our separate self-sense in the West has caused much of the trouble we are in now having exploited nature for our own benefit and to the detriment of overall well-being of our home…. As a member of [Integral Africa](https://www.thecoachingcentre.co.za/), we explore "how to do human better" and "how to become better ancestors."
