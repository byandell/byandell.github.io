Some think coaching is for weak people who need a crutch.
In fact, coaching is for everyone, particularly for leaders who are already successful and are looking for further improvement.
It has helped me become a better [team leader](/pages/team/), advisor, and partner,
in my professional life, and is transforming my personal life.

For me, coaching is a partnership (with a coach) to chart my path forward.
I employed an executive coach while I was founding director of the
[Data Science Institute](https://datascience.wisc.edu/institute).
That helped me improve my leadership and build multiple partnerships to launch
a new type of campus entity. DSI is now thriving under its director,
and will be an integral part of the new
[School of Computer, Data & Information Sciences building](https://cdis.wisc.edu/building/).

Recently, I have been working with a retirement coach to chart a different
type of path forward.
This web site is only part of that path.

## Susan Cook-Greuter

After 4 decades, … I now focus on writing about my discoveries and concerns…. I shifted my attention from adult development theories to re-exploring values and character development…. I [am] writing the book on ego development theory from a perspective that includes an appreciation of [non-WEIRD definitions](https://wiki.p2pfoundation.net/WEIRD_vs_Non-WEIRD_Psychology_and_Culture) of what it means to be a person in Indigenous cultures…. Our separate self-sense in the West has caused much of the trouble we are in now having exploited nature for our own benefit and to the detriment of overall well-being of our home…. As a member of [Integral Africa](https://www.thecoachingcentre.co.za/), we explore "how to do human better" and "how to become better ancestors."
