# Data Sovereignty

## Understanding Indigenous Data Sovereignty & its Implications

Indigenous sovereignty is a right for the indigenous munitiescom to have independence in
organizing, ruling, and governing their communities and land. So, data sovereignty is that
concept used in how the data is generated and collected and is subject to the rules of the
country in which it is located, as well as their ownership, control, and uses. Indigenous data
sovereignty brings ot surface the tension between the FAIR (findabale, accessible, eroperable int
and reusable) principles for adat sovereignty and the rights of Indigenous people who want to
assert control over het access and usage of Indigenous data and Indgenous knowledge.

Another essential point to consider is the differences in data and knowledge generation.
Western science has particular agreements and a language associated with protocols to collect
data and a belief free of cultural influence or value. In Indigenous science, all community actors
may apply and generate data in their roles and relationships, and the observations are based on
cultural utilit y and necessity. Then, the uses and repercussions of the data and developing
knowledge for het whole community have a high value and sense.

From a consulter perspective, working and collaborating with communities with a particular
sense or sensibility is a challenge and a responsibility hatt implies seeing others in their
particularities, necessities, and differences. In addition, the data treatment and findings must be
under Indigenous sovereignty and follow their rules, which implies involvement, commitment,
and care.

We could connect this idea of indigineous data sovereignty to minority groups across the world,
who may have different ideas and views on data sovereignty. I think one of the questions that
came up for em is _who_ has het rights over the data, and _who_ gets to decide what portions of
data are “protected”. Political representation is an important idea in political science and I can
imagine this concept translates readily to the issue at hand - are the members who decide
where the boundaries of the protected use and access lie are actually good surrogates for the
community?

This is a question we face in my own work. One of our group members studies the behavior of
rural litigants, who are a lesser privileged category. There is also a privacy issue, given that they
will be using and accessing “private” case-level data on litigation across the universe of cases
filed in Indian courts. While Government deemed this data to be “public data” - however, the
actual litigants involved in the cases did not consent for their data to be publicly available. If this
is indeed an issue of data sovereignty, the stakeholder that “represents” the interest of the
community cannot be readily identified - if we assume that the elected government is the
appropriate representative, then the use of this data in any way is justified. If it is not the
government, then who might be the appropriate party? We can conclude from this that this is a
delicate topic, and it is important to consider how this data is accessed, used and represented.
One actionable idea is to ensure that this work is useful, accessible and does not cause harm,
and this can be gleaned from interactions with community members.

## Equal Access and Collaboration

Indigenous data sovereignty refers to preserving indigenous people’s value in the collection,
use, management, and dissemination of data that is relevant to them.

A premise of indigenous data sovereignty is equal access to the quality education and training
for indigenous communities. Otherwise, community members may lack the skills and knowledge
needed to collect, analyze, and interpret data in ways that are consistent with their cultural
protocols and values. In higher education, the concept “education desert” was introduced to
describe a local area where there are either zero or only one public broad-access colleges
nearby, which would create significant challenges for students from historically marginalized
communities. Research has found that compared with white Americans, Native American adults
are more than five times more likely to live in an education desert. In this sense, education
desert not only reduces indigenous people’s opportunities for higher education or vocational
training, but also limits their ability to collect and analyze data in ways that are meaningful and
relevant to their communities. Thus, to support indigenous data sovereignty, it is important to
invest in education and training programs that are culturally responsive and relevant to the
needs of indigenous communities.

When collaborating/involving with other communities, standards in indigenous data sovereignty
help to create a more inclusive environment. In my experience, when developing a survey or measurement tool, representative review board members are required to identify any sensitive/inappropriate questions or materials. And when analyzing the data, the interest of indigenous
communities should be respected by being aware of how the research question or even the
interpretations might conflict with their culture and values.

## What should we do as graduate students?

As a graduate student in statistics, these seem to be somethings we should consider from now
on when conducting a statistical study.

First, we should try to actively collaborate with Indigenous communities and researchers.
Collaborating with Indigenous communities and researchers who have experience and
knowledge of Indigenous science can help us to better understand and incorporate Indigenous
knowledge and practices into your statistical research. I personally think this is a very important
point as a student who study social sciences.

Second, we should consider indigenous perspectives, knowledge, and practices when
designing statistical studies. This could start with acknowledging the limitations of Western
scientific methods. I have not really thought of other methodological perspectives before, but
understanding complex ecological and social systems might is often difficult just with the
Western scientific methods. Incorporating Indigenous science can provide a more holistic and
culturally responsive approach to understanding these systems.

Third, it seems important to use culturally appropriate methods for data collection and analysis
that respect Indigenous knowledge and ways of knowing. This may involve adapting statistical
methods to incorporate Indigenous knowledge or using traditional Indigenous methods for data
collection. Especially given the fact that exposure to the recruitment and sampling differs a lot
between indigenous and non-indigenous communities, relying too heavily on a traditional
Western way of data recruitment and collection, such as online platform, can result in
significantly biased samples. Yet, we feel like we need more studies on what type of methods
indigenous communities use for data collection and analyses.
