title: Data Evolve
---

The noun `data` implies it is somehow static. However, data evolve in multiple ways, such as:

- data evolve through collecting anew and extant data editing
- data evolve in context of changing metadata and harmonizing to clean data
- measurement tools evolve, which change precision and focus, altering meaning
- methods to examine data evolve insights through summaries and visualizations
- questions about data evolve as the broader context changes
- "small data" augmented by "Big Data" evolve our ability to ask questions

One `datum` (a single piece of data) may not change, but everything around it may, and hence its importance and value may change. A datum to one person or situation may be a world of data to another--consider a painting, which to one person may represent a single datum in a collection, such as current owner, while to another person may contain a rich history of technique, setting, artist, and [provenance](https://www.nnlm.gov/guides/data-glossary/data-provenance).

I started thinking about how data evolve in our lives as a verb when I met
[Jhon Goes-in-Center](https://thebrintonmuseum.org/jhon-duane-goes-in-center-2020-brinton-101/)
at the
[Exploring Data Sovereignty Workshop](https://ncar.ucar.edu/exploring-data-sovereignty-workshop) in Feb 2024.
He was musing on how difficult it is to understand the noun `data` when his Lakota language is woven with verbs. Later, when we were looking out at the huge cottonwood trees surrounding the [hogan](https://www.sipi.edu/pdf/SIPI_Campus_Map.pdf) where we were meeting, he talked about how everything is related by `evolution`--how these very trees have evolved to be successful in this seemingly dry land just a short walk from the Rio Grande River.

Much earlier, in Fall 2017, I wrote a living (evolving) document as a guide for the language [R for teams in the data sciences](https://github.com/UW-Madison-DataScience/R_for_data_sciences). I organized it as a series of verbs--curate, visualize, organize, analyze, profile, and connect--to emphasize how to think about examining data with such a language.
About that time, I and others were asking, [What is Data Science?](/What-is-Data-Science/)
Interestingly, `science` is also a noun. [What is Science?](https://undsci.berkeley.edu/understanding-science-101/what-is-science/), a 101-level explanation from UC-Berkely, points out that science is both a body of knowledge (noun) and a process (verb) of studying the world.
Science is very much verb-driven, as is the incorporation of data science into science to make sense of complex patterns and relationships.

Nowadays, I continue to rely on the lessons I learned building that guide.
I now think more about how [teams](/pages/team/) evolve their relationship with data,
and their relationship with tools to make sense of data.
Data is really about people and about how we form our data-informed stories,
much in the way [Jaron Lanier](/Jaron-Lanier-There-is-no-AI/) thinks about AI.
