title: Data Evolve
---

The noun `data` implies it is somehow static. However, data evolve in multiple ways, such as:

- data evolve through collecting anew and extant data editing
- data evolve in context of changing metadata and harmonizing to clean data
- measurement tools evolve, which change precision and focus, altering meaning
- methods to examine data evolve insights through summaries and visualizations
- questions about data evolve as the broader context changes
- "small data" augmented by "Big Data" evolve our ability to ask questions

One `datum` (a single piece of data) may not change, but everything around it may, and hence its importance and value may change. A datum to one person or situation may be a world of data to another--consider a picture, which may represent a single datum in a collection, or may be studied intently for the patterns within.

I started thinking about how data evolving in our lives acts as a verb when I met
[Jhon Goes-in-Center](https://thebrintonmuseum.org/jhon-duane-goes-in-center-2020-brinton-101/)
at the
[Exploring Data Sovereignty Workshop](https://ncar.ucar.edu/exploring-data-sovereignty-workshop) in Feb 2024.
He was musing on how difficult it is to understand the noun `data` when his Lakota language is woven with verbs. Later, when we were looking out at the huge cottonwood trees surrounding the hogan where we were meeting, he talked about how everything is related to `evolution`--how these very trees have evolved to be successful in this seemingly dry land just a short walk from the Rio Grande River.

Much earlier, in Fall 2017, I wrote a living (evolving) document as a guide for the language [R for teams in the data sciences](https://github.com/UW-Madison-DataScience/R_for_data_sciences). I organized it as a series of verbs--curate, visualize, organize, analyze, profile, and connect--to emphasize how to think about examining data with such a language.
About that time, I and others were asking, [What is Data Science?](/What-is-Data-Science/)
Interestingly, `science` is a noun, but the process of science, of studying the world,
is very much verb-driven.

Nowadays, I continue to rely on R and the lessons I learned building that guide.
I now think more about how [teams](/pages/team/) evolve their relationship with data,
and with tools to make sense of data.
Data is really about people and about how we form our data-informed stories,
much in the way [Jaron Lanier](/Jaron-Lanier-There-is-no-AI/) thinks about AI.
