title: Environmental Systems
---

Environmental systems are complex, multi-level communities and their geographic/spatial
components. Studying them often involves complicated models at multiple scale,
and data from disparate sources. It also involves people, animals, plants, river systems
and air systems. I am not an expert at any of these, but bring my expertise in
systems thinking and data science, combined with my ability to catalyze networks of
brilliant people, to collaborate toward effective study of environmental systems.
