title: Health Systems--Covid19
---

As Founding Director of the [Data Science Institute](https://datascience.wisc.edu/institute), I led a research team spanning the campus and beyond to the state, with a few more far-flung collaborators. This involved leading daily (soon weekly, later monthly) meetings with a variety of teams from March 2020 through 2022. We had near-weekly talks by a variety of people. My leadership helped connect people from disparate backgrounds to collaborate effectively.

One highly productive group collaborated with the CDC to study and, working with campus leaders, flatten a Covid19 outbreak in Fall 2020 
([Currie et al. 2021](https://doi.org/10.3201/eid2711.211306)).
Our team published an additional paper on forecasting cases ([Aravamuth et al. 2023](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-023-15160-6))
based on work we did with UW-Madison to
project need for isolation hotel rooms prior to Thanksgiving 2020.

Another collaboration with the [WI State Lab of Hygiene wastewater team](https://www.slh.wisc.edu/research/experts/) and the stated Divison of Public Health led to improvements in [measuring wastewater](https://www.slh.wisc.edu/environmental/covid-19-wastewater/) and accuracy and presentation of the [state wastewater surveilence dashboard](https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/covid-19/wastewater.htm). Members of our team developed a portable [Covid19 Wastewater Analysis Package](https://github.com/UW-Madison-DSI/Covid19Wastewater).
Our collaborations helped WSLH get awarded a [CDC Center of Excellence for wastewater surveillance](https://www.slh.wisc.edu/wisconsin-named-national-center-of-excellence-for-wastewater-surveillance/).

## Web Pages

Our group developed a number of web pages to communicate with
the public and with decision makers at UW-Madison and health leaders across the state and beyond. Sri talked about our work at UW's Posit Day 2024. Many of those pages are now defunct.
